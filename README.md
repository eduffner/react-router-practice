React Router Course Project
========

#### This is the repository for the original project we'll build together during TylerMcGinnis.com's "React Router 4" course, for more information on the course see [tylermcginnis.com/courses](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses)

The main idea of this app is you have a league of teams and you can view information about each team like roster, articles, etc.

## Notes
Each commit is a rewrite of the app. First it's coded with React Router 4, then RR5, then RR6. I did this as a practice to help myself remember the distinguishing features of each library.

## Run
To run the app, it's pretty self explanatory:
- Clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
